# NHSBSA Open Data roadmap

üëâ View the [NHSBSA public Open Data roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nhsbsa-data-analytics/projects/2/views/1)

Our roadmap  is where users of our [NHSBSA Open Data Portal (ODP)](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/) can learn about what we're working on and when we expect to deliver them.

Questions, comments, and suggestions for the roadmap can be left on the [NHSBSA Open Data roadmap feedback discussions](https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/open-data-roadmap/discussions) üó®Ô∏è. This roadmap repository is primarily for us to communicate what we're working on to our users and open data community, therefore issues are read only, and conversations are locked.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is a GitHub issue, organised into general release quarters, and labeled to indicate:

* a **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for more information on release phases.
* a **product area** that indicates the general type of work the issue relates to. See below for more information on product areas.
* a **theme** that indicates the area within the ODP that the item belongs to. See below for more information on themes.
* one or more **release types** that indicate the mechanism used to make a data set open. See below for more information on release types.
* once an item is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue; the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant resource and moved the "Done" stage.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense of how far out each item is on the horizon. Each roadmap item is added to a project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to be completed. This roadmap is subject to change and is not a commitment by the NHSBSA to deliver a product or feature by a particular date. This is especially true of roadmap items that are further out on the timeline.

You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjuction with other labels to describe when a roadmap item has no timeframe for delivery yet.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that a roadmap item goes through, from experimental design to general availability.

* **beta**: *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
New and innovative products that are still under development and subject to change. Not for production use, but released to allow users to give us their thoughts and help shape the future of the product.

* **production**: *Available in a stable state*\
Ready for production use. Data sets in a production phase will only have changes implemeted to revise and correct previously released figures. Large scale changes will only be implemented to production data sets following overwhelming user feedback.

* **improvement**: *For communitcating changes*\
This label is used for products that were previously in a production state but following user feedback is under development and subject to change. Caution should be used if building production workflows using these products.

Some Open Data products may still be in the exploratory stages and have no timeframe available. These are included in the raodmap for early feedback and communicate what we're working on and our priorities. These are marked as:

* **exploring**:\
We are are considering building this product and are gathering feedback on it.

* **in design**:\
In discovery phase. We have decided to build this product, but are still figuring out *how*.

## Product area

A **product area** shows the general type of work the issue relates to. These are:

* **dataset:** Issue relates to the creation or maintainence of an open data set.
* **platform:** Issue relates to improvements and new developments in our Open Data Portal or other data platforms.
* **code:** Releasing code repositories for pieces of analysis that our teams are working on.
* **analysis:** Publishing analysis for public consumption.

## Theme

The following are our current list of themes that our open data products can relate to. These broadly correspond to the themes held in the ODP:

* **experimental:** For new and innovative products.
* **prescribing:** Products relating to prescribing, community dispensing, and medicines data.
* **hospital:** Products relating to hospital & provider medicines.
* **dental:** Products relating to dental providers.
* **ophthalmic:** Products relating to Ophthalmic services.
